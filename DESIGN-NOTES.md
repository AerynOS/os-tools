# How AerynOS delivers software to OS installs

## Software package metadata: manifest.*.bin

The `manifest.${ARCH}.bin` files contain all the metadata needed by the AerynOS tooling. For context, the `manifest.${ARCH}.jsonc` files are only there for git diff purposes and human-readable insight. They are completely ignored by the tooling.

## Software distribution via *.stone packages

AerynOS distributes software via its custom `stone` format. This format was explicitly built to enable fast, deduplicated transmission and installation of software artefacts on target OS installs.

    > Context: we dont mix layout + metadata (unlike in alpine, where tar records are used for metadata)
    > in fact we explicitly separate them
    > so a "normal" stone file has a meta payload with strongly typed/tagged key value pairs/sets
    > a content payload which is every unique file concatanated into a "megablob" and compressed singly 
    > an index payload which is a jump table into offsets in the unpacked content payload
    > to allow the xxhash128 keying
    > ie "position one is hash xyz"
    > and lastly there is the layout payload which is a meta-ish payload containing a set of records that define how the package is laid out on disk when installed
    > so the paths, file types, modes, link targets, permissions
    > and optionally for regular files, the xxh128 hash
    > so when we "cache" / install a package, in reality we're ripping the content payload out, then using the index payload to shard it into the unique assets in the store to build up the content addressable storage
    > we then merge the entries from metapayload + layoutpayload into the DBs
    > and we use the unique package "id" to key it, ie the hash for the `.stone`
    > internally moss has a notion of "State" whereby it maps your explicitly / transitive selections for a transaction into those pkgids
    > and during composition ("blit") we load all the required ids/etc/ and produce an in memory VFS structure using those "LayoutEntry"
    > and then blit in optimal order into a tree using linkat, mkdirat, etc.
